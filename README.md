### 
A simple web page to share files to different devices.  All the device needs is a web browser.

Alternative to Airdrop, Quick share, sharedrop.io, snapdrop.net, etc.

Uses WebRTC.  Works if the two devices are connected to the same network.

### Troubleshooting...

* It may not work in public WiFis because their security may restrict devices from transferring to each other.  You can make one of the devices a hotspot and connect to the hotspot to make the transfer.
* If big files are getting stuck and the progress bar is not moving.  Some WiFi adpaters struggle on full load, use the non-5G WiFi(2.4GHz) if you can.
* Don't open in multiple tabs because they will share the same name.  If you wish to use multiple tabs, use another user or use a incognito/private browsing tab.
* If it doesn't connect, refresh the web browser on both sides.
* If it doesn't work and you're using VPNs.  Turn off VPNs.  Sometimes it will get confused about which network to use to connect to the other device.
