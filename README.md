### 
A simple web page to share files to different devices.  All the device needs is a web browser.

Alternative to Airdrop, Quick share, sharedrop.io, snapdrop.net, etc.

Uses WebRTC.  Works if the two devices are connected to the same network.

### Troubleshooting...

* Don't open in multiple tabs because they will share the same name.  If you wish to use multiple tabs, use another user or use a incognito/private browsing tab.
* If it doesn't connect, refresh the web browser on both sides.
* Turn off VPNs, sometimes it will get confused about which network to use to connect to the other device.
